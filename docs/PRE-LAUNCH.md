# Pre-launch setup & publishing guide

> **What this is.** [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) and [`APP-STORE.md`](APP-STORE.md)
> document how to *run* the release pipeline. They assume you already hold the Apple
> credentials, signing keys, and distribution accounts. This file is the missing half:
> the **one-time, manual, off-repo setup** you must do before that pipeline can ship a
> real build — how to get each account/credential, the **naming** decisions to lock in,
> the in-repo **placeholders** to fill, and **advice for publishing** the app.
>
> Nothing here is code. The code, CI, and pipeline scaffolding are done and green; what
> remains is human: open accounts, generate keys, fill placeholders, and announce.

## 0. Status at a glance

| Area | State | Who/what does it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App code, tests, CI | ✅ Done, green | The repo |
| Release pipeline (DMG, notarize, Sparkle appcast, cask template, QA scripts) | ✅ Scaffolded | `release.yml`, `scripts/*` |
| App Store dry-run pipeline | ✅ Scaffolded | `appstore.yml` |
| Apple Developer account | ⬜ **You, manually** | §1 |
| Developer ID certificate (.p12) | ⬜ **You, manually** | §2 |
| App Store Connect API key (.p8) | ⬜ **You, manually** | §2 |
| Sparkle EdDSA keys | ⬜ **You, manually** | §3 |
| GitHub repo secrets | ⬜ **You, manually** | §4 |
| GitHub Pages (Sparkle feed) | ⬜ **You, manually** | §5 |
| Homebrew tap repo | ⬜ **You, manually** | §5 |
| Naming decisions locked | ⬜ **Decide before first tag** | §6 |
| In-repo placeholders filled | ⬜ 3 placeholders | §7 |
| First release + announce | ⬜ After the above | §8–§9 |

**Minimum to ship a trustworthy direct-download DMG:** §1 → §2 (Developer ID + notary
key) → §4 (secrets) → §7 (fill `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`) → tag. Sparkle (§3), the tap (§5),
and the App Store (§8) are each independent add-ons you can do later.

---

## 1. Apple Developer Program account

Everything Apple-signed (notarization, Developer ID, the App Store) requires a paid
membership. The free Apple ID is **not** enough for notarization or Developer ID.

- **Where:** <https://developer.apple.com/programs/> → *Enroll*.
- **Cost:** USD **$99/year** (individual or organization). An organization enrollment
  needs a D-U-N-S number and takes longer; an **individual** enrollment is fine for a
  solo open-source app and is faster.
- **Time:** minutes to a few days (identity verification can lag).
- **What it unlocks:** Developer ID certificates, the notary service, App Store Connect,
  and your 10-character **Team ID** (needed everywhere below).
- **Find your Team ID:** <https://developer.apple.com/account> → *Membership details* →
  *Team ID* (e.g. `A1B2C3D4E5`).

> If you only ever want the App Store channel, you still need this. If you only ever want
> the DMG channel, you still need this (notarization is mandatory for Gatekeeper).

---

## 2. Signing & notarization credentials

Two things: a **Developer ID Application certificate** (signs the app) and an **App
Store Connect API key** (notarizes it, and later uploads to the App Store).

### 2a. Developer ID Application certificate → `.p12`

This is the identity Gatekeeper trusts for a direct download.

1. Easiest path — **Xcode**: *Settings ▸ Accounts ▸* (your Apple ID) *▸ Manage
   Certificates ▸ + ▸ Developer ID Application*. Xcode creates it and stores the private
   key in your login Keychain.
   - Manual path: *Keychain Access ▸ Certificate Assistant ▸ Request a Certificate from a
     Certificate Authority* (save a CSR), then upload it at
     <https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates> → *+* → **Developer ID
     Application**, download the `.cer`, and double-click to install.
2. **Export the `.p12`** (cert **+** private key): in *Keychain Access*, find *Developer
   ID Application: …*, right-click ▸ **Export**, choose `.p12`, set a strong **export
   password** (you'll store it as a secret).
3. Note the **identity name** exactly: `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)`.
   List it any time with:
   ```bash
   security find-identity -v -p codesigning
   ```

### 2b. App Store Connect API key → `.p8` (preferred for notarization & App Store)

One key both **notarizes** the DMG (CS-061) and **uploads** App Store builds (CS-062).

1. <https://appstoreconnect.apple.com> → *Users and Access ▸ Integrations ▸ App Store
   Connect API* → **Generate API Key** (name it e.g. "Vitrine CI"; a *Developer*-level
   role is sufficient for notarization and uploads).
2. **Download the `.p8` immediately — it is shown only once.** Store it securely (a
   password manager); losing it means generating a new one.
3. Record the **Key ID** (10 chars) and the **Issuer ID** (a UUID shown above the keys
   list). You now have the trio: `.p8` file, Key ID, Issuer ID.

> The Apple-ID-and-app-specific-password style still works as a fallback (see the table
> in [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md#credentials-repository-secrets)), but the API key is
> preferred — no password rotation, and it doubles for App Store uploads.

---

## 3. Sparkle auto-update keys (EdDSA) — optional, for the DMG channel

Only needed if you want the direct-download build to auto-update. The App Store channel
ignores Sparkle entirely. Full flow: [`RELEASING.md` ▸ Auto-update](RELEASING.md#auto-update-sparkle--cs-064).

> **Do this _before_ tagging v0.1.0.** macOS reads `SUPublicEDKey` at launch, so the
> public key must already be embedded in the **first** shipped build. If v0.1.0 ships with
> the placeholder key, that installed base can **never** auto-update — every user would
> have to re-download the DMG by hand to reach v0.2.0. Generating the keys and filling the
> placeholder (§7) is therefore a **pre-v0.1.0 requirement**, not a later step. Skip all of
> §3 only if you deliberately don't want auto-update at all.

1. Download a Sparkle release (`Sparkle-<version>.tar.xz`) from
   <https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases> and run its tool:
   ```bash
   ./bin/generate_keys        # prints the PUBLIC key; stores the PRIVATE key in your Keychain
   ```
2. Put the **public** key in the repo (§7): `Info.plist` → `SUPublicEDKey`.
3. Export the **private** key and store it as a GitHub secret, then delete the local copy:
   ```bash
   ./bin/generate_keys -x sparkle_private_key.pem
   gh secret set SPARKLE_EDDSA_PRIVATE_KEY < sparkle_private_key.pem
   rm sparkle_private_key.pem
   ```

> Back up the private key like the Developer ID cert. Losing it means the installed base
> can no longer verify (and therefore install) any future update.

## 4. GitHub repository secrets

Set these on `johnny4young/vitrine` (*Settings ▸ Secrets and variables ▸ Actions*), or
with the `gh` CLI. Each pipeline stage is **gated** on its secret and **skips cleanly**
when absent — so you can add them incrementally and a fork still gets a green unsigned
build.

| Secret | From | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_TEAM_ID` | §1 Team ID | Signing + notarization (also `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`) |
| `MACOS_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` | §2a identity name | Signing the app/DMG |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12` | §2a `.p12`, base64 | Importing the cert on the runner |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | §2a export password | Decrypting the `.p12` |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_P8` | §2b `.p8`, base64 | Notarization (preferred) |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID` | §2b Key ID | Notarization |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ISSUER_ID` | §2b Issuer ID | Notarization |
| `SPARKLE_EDDSA_PRIVATE_KEY` | §3 private key | Signing the Sparkle appcast |

Base64-and-set the file secrets straight from the source files:

```bash
base64 -i DeveloperID.p12          | gh secret set MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12
base64 -i AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8     | gh secret set MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_P8
gh secret set MACOS_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY  --body "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
gh secret set MACOS_NOTARY_TEAM_ID      --body "TEAMID"
gh secret set MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID       --body "XXXXXXXXXX"
gh secret set MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ISSUER_ID --body "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
gh secret set MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD --body "•••"
```

> **Never commit any of these.** They live only as GitHub secrets and in your password
> manager. The repo is public.

---

## 5. Distribution infrastructure (create once)

### 5a. GitHub Pages — hosts the Sparkle appcast

`Info.plist`'s `SUFeedURL` is `https://johnny4young.github.io/vitrine/appcast.xml`. For
that URL to resolve, enable Pages on this repo: *Settings ▸ Pages ▸ Build and deployment ▸
Source = GitHub Actions*. `release.yml` then deploys the signed `appcast.xml` there on
each tagged release. (No Pages = no auto-update feed; the DMG still ships.)

### 5b. Homebrew tap — `johnny4young/homebrew-tap`

So users can `brew install --cask johnny4young/tap/vitrine`:

1. Create a **public** repo named exactly **`homebrew-tap`** under your account.
2. Add `Casks/vitrine.rb` — a copy of this repo's [`packaging/Casks/vitrine.rb`](../packaging/Casks/vitrine.rb)
   with the real `version` and `sha256` (the release publishes a ready-to-paste
   `vitrine-cask-update.txt`; see [`RELEASING.md` ▸ Homebrew](RELEASING.md#homebrew-cask--cs-063)).
3. Audit + smoke-test in the tap before announcing (commands in `RELEASING.md`).

> The cask's `sha256` placeholder (all zeros) in this repo is intentional — the **real**
> checksum only exists once a DMG is published, and the release computes it for you.

---

## 6. Naming — lock these in **before** the first tag

Some names are effectively permanent once the installed base or the App Store has them.
Decide deliberately now.

| Surface | Current value | Changeable later? | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bundle identifier | `app.vitrine` | ❌ **Immutable** once installed/on the App Store | **Decide now.** Register it as an **App ID** in the Developer portal; if taken, pick an alternative (e.g. `app.vitrine.mac`, or `com.<you>.vitrine`). |
| App display name | `Vitrine` | App Store: hard; binary: easy | App Store names are **globally unique** — confirm "Vitrine" is free when you create the App Store record; keep a fallback like **"Vitrine — Code to Image"**. |
| Homebrew cask token | `vitrine` | Cheap pre-adoption | Keep. |
| Tap repo | `johnny4young/homebrew-tap` | — | Create (§5b). |
| Sparkle feed host | `johnny4young.github.io/vitrine` | tied to repo name | Keep, or move to a custom domain later. |
| Marketing domain | _(none)_ | — | **Optional but recommended:** grab `vitrine.app` (the reverse-DNS your bundle ID implies) for a landing page + a stable Sparkle/download URL. |

**On `app.vitrine`:** the reverse-DNS convention implies the domain `vitrine.app`. You do
**not** have to own that domain for the bundle ID to work, but owning it future-proofs the
identity and gives you a home for the landing page and `appcast.xml`. The bundle ID is the
one truly irreversible choice — changing it after release orphans every installed copy and
forces a new App Store listing.

**Trademark sanity check:** "Vitrine" is a common word (French/architectural for *display
case/showcase*), so trademark risk is low, but do a quick search for an existing macOS dev
tool of the same name before you print it on a release.

---

## 7. In-repo placeholders to fill

Three committed placeholders currently keep the repo building **without** an Apple account.
Fill them as you complete the steps above (each is a small, explicit edit):

| Placeholder | File | Replace with | After step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM: ""` | `project.yml` | Your 10-char Team ID | §1 |
| `SUPublicEDKey` = `REPLACE_WITH_SPARKLE_EDDSA_PUBLIC_KEY` | `Vitrine/Resources/Info.plist` | Sparkle public key | §3 |
| cask `sha256` = all-zeros | `packaging/Casks/vitrine.rb` (template) | _leave as-is_ — the **tap** copy gets the real checksum per release | §5b |

> Bumping `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is also available via the `MACOS_NOTARY_TEAM_ID` secret for
> CI signing; set the `project.yml` value only if you also build/sign locally.

---

## 8. Choosing the channel(s)

You can ship either or both. They share **one** app target — no divergent builds.

| | Direct-download DMG (primary) | Mac App Store (optional) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gate | Notarization (automated) | Human App Review (days) |
| Updates | Sparkle, instant | App Store, on its cadence |
| Reach | Power users, `brew`, your site | Casual discovery, search |
| Cut | $99/yr + the steps above | + App Store record, screenshots, review notes |
| Recommended first | ✅ **Ship this first** | Add later if you want discoverability |

**Recommendation:** ship the **notarized DMG + Homebrew cask** for v0.1.0 (it's the
fastest path to a trustworthy install and matches a dev-tool audience). Treat the App
Store as a **post-v0.1** follow-up — `appstore.yml` and [`APP-STORE.md`](APP-STORE.md) are
already prepared for it, including the App Review notes to paste.

---

## 9. The first release & publishing advice

### 9a. Cut the release (mechanics in `RELEASING.md`)

The short version once §1–§7 are done:

1. Fill `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, bump `MARKETING_VERSION`/`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` if needed,
   add a `ReleaseNotes.swift` entry, `make icon` if the icon changed.
2. `make lint && make build && make test` green; run `make test-ui` locally once.
3. `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0` → `release.yml` builds, signs, notarizes,
   and publishes the DMG + `appcast.xml`.
4. **Clean-Mac QA** with `scripts/qa-release.sh` against the *published* DMG (§ the
   CS-066 checklist in `RELEASING.md`) — the only check that proves a stranger's Mac
   accepts it.
5. Open the tap PR (paste `vitrine-cask-update.txt`); smoke-test `brew install`.

### 9b. Have these ready before you announce

- **README that sells in 5 seconds:** a looping **GIF/screen-capture** of Quick Capture →
  image at the very top (use Vitrine itself for the code shots). The tagline is already
  good; add an animated demo.
- **3–5 polished sample images** (you can render them with `make gallery`).
- **Install one-liner** front and center: `brew install --cask johnny4young/tap/vitrine`.
- A short **CHANGELOG**/release notes (the in-app "What's New" already covers users).
- Optional: a tiny **landing page** at `vitrine.app` (even a one-pager) — lends legitimacy
  and gives non-GitHub users somewhere to land.

### 9c. Where to launch (a dev tool's audience)

- **Show HN** ("Show HN: Vitrine – turn code into images from your macOS menu bar"). Post
  in the morning ET on a weekday; be present in the thread to answer.
- **Product Hunt** — schedule for 00:01 PT; line up the GIF + first comment.
- **Reddit:** r/macapps, r/swift, r/MacOS (read each subreddit's self-promo rules first).
- **Lobsters**, **Hacker News**, **Mastodon/Bluesky/X** dev communities, and any
  Swift/macOS Discord/Slack you're in.
- **GitHub hygiene that compounds:** set repo **topics** (`macos`, `swift`, `swiftui`,
  `menu-bar`, `developer-tools`, `code-to-image`), a crisp description, and a pinned
  release. Stars and the Homebrew cask are the social proof that pulls the next user.

### 9d. After launch

- **Measure without telemetry** (the app collects none, by design): GitHub stars, release
  **download counts**, `brew` analytics (`brew info --cask vitrine`), and issue volume.
- **Cadence:** ship small, frequent Sparkle updates — a smooth first auto-update is a
  strong trust signal. Bump `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` every release or Sparkle won't see
  the build as newer.
- **Triage** issues/PRs quickly in the first week; first impressions set the tone for an
  open-source project.
- **Sustainability (optional):** GitHub Sponsors / "Buy me a coffee" link in the README;
  the MIT license already invites contribution.
