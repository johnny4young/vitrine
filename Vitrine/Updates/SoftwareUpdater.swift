/// Vitrine's direct-download build (the signed, notarized DMG) updates itself with
/// [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org): it checks a signed EdDSA appcast and installs
/// the next build without a manual reinstall. The feed URL and the EdDSA public key live
/// in `Info.plist` (`SUFeedURL` / `SUPublicEDKey`); the private key lives only in the
/// release maintainer's Keychain (see `docs/RELEASING.md`).
///
/// ## Channel gating — the App Store build excludes Sparkle
///
/// Every Sparkle symbol is compiled only when `VITRINE_DIRECT_DOWNLOAD` is defined, which
/// the normal build sets (see `project.yml`). The optional Mac App Store build removes that
/// flag and strips the framework, so the App Store binary contains no Sparkle and no
/// update-check UI — the App Store owns its own update mechanism, and a third-party updater
/// is not permitted there. On that build this type still exists but degrades to a no-op:
/// `isSupported` is `false` and "Check for Updates" is hidden, so the rest of the app links
/// against a single, stable API regardless of channel.
///
/// ## Privacy — no analytics
///
/// The updater collects nothing. Sparkle's optional anonymous system-profiling feature stays
/// off (`SUEnableSystemProfiling` is absent/`NO` in `Info.plist`, and no profiling delegate
/// is installed), so an update check sends only the request needed to fetch the appcast and
/// the chosen download — no usage data, no identifiers, no telemetry. This keeps the
/// menu-bar app's on-device, account-less promise intact for the update path too.
